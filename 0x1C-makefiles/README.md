What are make and Makefiles?

make is a build automation tool that helps in compiling and building software projects. It reads a file called Makefile to determine how to compile and link the project's source files.
A Makefile is a simple text file that contains instructions for make on how to compile and link the project. It typically includes rules, dependencies, and commands for building the project.
When, why, and how to use Makefiles?

Makefiles are used primarily in software development projects to automate the build process. They are useful when you have a project with multiple source files that need to be compiled and linked together.
You use Makefiles to specify the dependencies between different files in your project and the commands needed to build them. This ensures that only the necessary files are recompiled when changes are made, saving time during development.
What are rules and how to set and use them?

Rules in a Makefile define how to create a target file from its dependencies. They consist of a target, dependencies, and commands.
The syntax for a rule is:
makefile
Copy code
target: dependencies
    commands
When you run make, it checks each target's dependencies and executes the commands associated with the rule if any of the dependencies are newer than the target, or if the target doesn't exist.
What are explicit and implicit rules?

Explicit rules are those where you explicitly specify the target and dependencies along with the commands to build the target.
Implicit rules are predefined rules in make for common compilation tasks. For example, make knows how to compile a .c file into a .o file without needing an explicit rule for it.
What are the most common/useful rules?

Some common rules include:
all: To build the entire project.
clean: To remove all generated files.
install: To install the compiled software.
uninstall: To uninstall the installed software.
These rules can be customized based on the project's requirements.
What are variables and how to set and use them?

Variables in Makefiles allow you to define values that can be used throughout the Makefile.
You can set variables using the syntax VARIABLE_NAME = value.
To use a variable, you simply reference it using $(VARIABLE_NAME).
Variables are helpful for storing compiler flags, file paths, and other repetitive values to avoid redundancy and make the Makefile more maintainable.
